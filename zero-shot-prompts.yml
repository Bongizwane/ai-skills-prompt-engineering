I hope this message finds you well.
I‚Äôm writing to inform you of a revised timeline for the WhatsApp integration project. Due to unforeseen technical challenges, we will need to extend the delivery date by two weeks. We sincerely apologize for this delay and appreciate your understanding and continued support.

We now anticipate completing the integration by [New Date], with system testing and deployment beginning the following week.
Next Steps

- Conduct end-to-end testing and quality assurance
- Prepare deployment documentation and user guides
- Schedule stakeholder review ahead of launch
